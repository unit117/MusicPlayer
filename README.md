<details><summary>Read me before using MPRIS</summary>

##### dependencies

- [playerctl](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl) (could be installed by package manager)

> A running `GMainLoop` is required to automatically update the player and playback status for MPRIS.
> If not, you can run one by: 
> ```swift
> GRunLoop.main.run()
> ```
> or in other threads:
> ```swift
> Thread.detachNewThread {

## Usage

### Quick Start

```swift
let player = MusicPlayers.Scriptable(name: .appleMusic)!
let track = player.currentTrack.title
if player.playbackState.isPlaying {
    player.skipToNextItem()
}
```

### Async/Await (Swift Concurrency)

```swift
// Stream playback state changes
for await state in player.playbackStateStream {
    print("Playback state: \(state)")
}

// Stream track changes
for await track in player.currentTrackStream {
    print("Now playing: \(track?.title ?? "Nothing")")
}
```

### SwiftUI Integration with @Observable (macOS 14+, iOS 17+)

```swift
import SwiftUI
import MusicPlayer

struct PlayerView: View {
    @State private var observablePlayer = ObservableMusicPlayer()
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            if let track = observablePlayer.currentTrack {
                Text(track.title ?? "Unknown")
                Text(track.artist ?? "Unknown Artist")
            }
            
            HStack {
                Button("Previous") { observablePlayer.skipToPreviousItem() }
                Button(observablePlayer.playbackState.isPlaying ? "Pause" : "Play") {
                    observablePlayer.playPause()
                }
                Button("Next") { observablePlayer.skipToNextItem() }
            }
        }
        .onAppear {
            if let player = MusicPlayers.Scriptable(name: .appleMusic) {
                observablePlayer.setPlayer(player)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
